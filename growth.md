I am very insecure. I'm not confident.

Bravery is the deliberate act of acting tough even when you are scared.

I need to act confident even when I am not.

I lost her for being a coward. Do not make the same mistake again.

Under her eyes, I turned into this zombie. I showed her my third face. The one I even tried to hide from myself. And I lost her.

It makes me sick up to this date. I loved her with all my heart, and in a way I am still longing to see her.

I think she was so good for me. And deep down she knows I was good for her too.

But that's how life is supposed to be. Two souls that once loved each other wandering around as strangers who will never meet again.

And all that's left for me to do is learn from those mistakes. The third face I shall hide, confidence I must fake, pride I will swallow.

And maybe that way I will see her again.
