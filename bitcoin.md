**The soundest form of money**

*It's always been very clear in my head that money is a technology. I believe it's the most interesting technology to ever exist. 
What other technology quantifies human productivity? In this case, "productivity" = time * energy expenditure.*

**Fallacy # 1 about money**

*The collective delusion*

*"If we believe something is money, it will be money."*

**I passionately believe this is wrong.**

*However, I'll bite. Tomorrow every person on Earth wakes up and we agree to use apples as money.
Apples will serve as unit of account, medium of exchange and store of value. Great.*

*Nature will do what nature does and inevitably the apples will rot. Humans will do what humans do
and the entreprenurial minds will harvest more apples. Nature's work will ground you to the physical
reality because how can we store human productivity in a product that is not saleable across time?
The entreprenurial minds will dillute your apples' worth.*

**And people like me will be trying as hard as they can to short apples. First, I would start by getting rid of all my apples.
I would try to exchange them for a product that is saleable across time and space. If it's hard to produce, even better.**

*It's wierd that best technology ever created by us humans is dimished to invisible numbers in a screen. There is nothing invisible about Bitcoin.
Strings of code that produce 21 million units. At least that's what most of the population thinks.*

*Bitcoin is the best abstraction of human productivity because it is bounded by physical reality. If our productivity is measured by our time and energy expenditure, isn't it ironic that bitcoin is the only protocol that respects these attributes?*

**Foolishly, I used to wish I could be born back in the early days of IP/TCP.
"Had I only gotten the chance, I would have seen the impact it would cause in the world." Those were my thoughts.
Ironically, I am born right in the perfect time. This technology is something like I have never experienced before.**

*I can't sleep thinking about ways to interact with it. Every day I want to build more on top of this protocol of money. Every paycheck I earn is to provide a living and buy bitcoin. Buying something that is not bitcoin, at least to me, is like shorting bitcoin itself. Unacceptable.*
