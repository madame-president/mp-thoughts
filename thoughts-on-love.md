*In my mind, I see this figure that really loves me. When my day is done, I think about this figure and why we are to be seperated.*

*I long the connection we shared, it meant a lot to me. For however unidirectional it was, it felt like electricity running through me.*

*Perhaps love is less abstract than I thought. Or perhaps energy itself is just an abstraction, and love a manifestation of energy itself.*

**Abstraction or not, it manifested into my physical reality. I felt it vividly in my world.**
